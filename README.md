1. Project Overview
Project Name: Jalum's Baby Clothes Website
Prepared By: [Sophia Salim]
Version: 1.0

1.1. Project Description
The Jalum's Baby Clothes Website aims to showcase premium baby clothing products to potential customers. The website will be a multipage, responsive, and interactive platform consisting of a Home, About, and Contact page. It will provide information about the brand, its products, and offer a way for customers to contact the company. The website will be built using HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript to create an engaging and user-friendly experience.

1.2. Purpose
The primary goal of this website is to build an online presence for Jalum's Baby Clothes. It will serve as a digital storefront where visitors can learn about the brand, explore the clothing products, and get in touch with the company.

2. Business Objectives

Provide an engaging, easy-to-navigate website that introduces the brand, its values, and its products.

Promote Products:

Use images and content to highlight baby clothing, creating a visually appealing presentation to attract potential customers.

Provide a Contact Platform:

Enable users to contact the business through a form where they can submit their inquiries or feedback.

Ensure Responsiveness:

The website should adapt to different screen sizes (mobile, tablet, desktop) to enhance the user experience across all devices.

3. Functional Requirements

Home Page

Navigation Bar: Links to Home, About, and Contact pages.

Hero Section: Large welcoming message and a brief description of the brand.

3.3. Design
Color Scheme: Soft, pastel colors, primarily pink, for a baby-friendly and professional aesthetic.

Typography: Clear, modern fonts such as "Segoe UI" for readability.

Responsive Design: The layout should adjust based on screen size to ensure mobile-friendly browsing.
